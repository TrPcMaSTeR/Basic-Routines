## Project starting instructions:

If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/TrPcMaSTeR/Basic-Routines
cd Basic-Routines
expo start
```

Without Expo:

If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:

```
git clone https://github.com/TrPcMaSTeR/Basic-Routines
cd Basic-Routines
expo eject
npm install
react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
```
